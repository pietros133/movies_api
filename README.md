# movies_api
This project is a simple API developed in Python with Flask, allowing you to search for movies by name or ID. The API provides endpoints to search for movie information, returning data such as title, release year, and genre. Users can search for movies using a specific name or ID, providing a convenient way to access movie details directly from the web.
